This is the foundation of Rosso, I think I have it figured out this time.

This will take years of work, but I think it is worth it

POP
====
First we need plugin oriented Programming, take the existing models but remove the hub,
everything is a pack, no more trine concept

Speed up contracts and local lookups

Tools
=====

Merge conf into tools, and add in packs for:
aioproc
process manager
logging
network topologies - aio

Then we can start on Rosso, it will have a number of application enabled network topologies and we will
pull concepts in from Salt as well.
