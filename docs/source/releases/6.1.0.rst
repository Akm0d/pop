=================
Pop Release 6.1.0
=================

The Plugin Oriented Programming implementation has reached version 6.1.0!

This version has a few updates and fixes, nothing major apart from fixing
a major issue in the `dyne_name` system introduced in 6.0.0

Dyne Name Fix
=============

When importing a module it needs to be given a reference name with the
`sys.modules` dict as part of the import. There was in issue with how these
names were being generated for the dyne_name system. It was repaired
by making unknown path originating refs prefaced with a random
string. This should likely be refined in the future to reference the
actual file path.

Remove Last imp Refs
====================

The imp library has been deprecated since python 3.3, but it was still
being used, primarily out of old habits! All `imp` refs have now been
removed.

Refined pypath Inferred Names
=============================

When pypath is used to add a new sub to your hub the name of the sub
can be dynamically derived from the pypath. There was a bug where if the
pypath was a list this would fail, it has been fixed.
