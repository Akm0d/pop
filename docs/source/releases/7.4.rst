Pop Release 7.4
===============

This release fixes some bugs and adds initial Windows support

Windows Support
===============

POP now runs on Windows! The only things left to add is to make the
conf system more robust on Windows. We add the ability
for the conf system to get options from the registry in the same way that
Linux can use environment variables. We also need to add automatic path
management for Windows as it exists for root/user paths on Linux.

Windows support for loops also changed, there were issues in using the
Proactor loop and now we just use the default loop. This implies that
Python 3.8 should be used for Windows as it uses the Proactor loop by
default.

Add pop-seed -t v
=================

With the introduction of Idem it has become expedient to allow pop-seed to
create POP trees that do not include the tools needed for a standalone
project but just the structure for a vertical app-merge project. This
can now be accomplished with the `pop-seed -t v <project name>` command. 

Update Quickstart
=================

The quickstart guide has been updated to reflect changes made in POP 7
and made to be more fluid in exposing the RPC concept. It also got the
addition of some curl commands to test poppy.
