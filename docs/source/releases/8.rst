=============
Pop Release 8
=============

Pop 8 introduces a few structural changes to the loader and some major additions
to `pop-seed`.

Function Variable Pass Through
==============================

Pop wraps functions on the hub with contracted objects. This resulted in an issue
where decorators that add variables to function objects did not always become
visible to the contracted objects on the hub. This prevented decorators in
a number of tools to not work with `pop`.

To fix this we have made it so that function level variables are now available on
the contracted object.

Pop Seed Additions
==================

Pop-seed now uses Dynamic Names by default when creating new projects. This moves
the mindset towards making sure that developers are more app-merge centric.

The ability to add dynamic names to the conf during the `pop-seed` call have also
been added. Now it is possible to pass the -d option to `pop-seed` and list what
dynamic names need to be created. Then those dynamic names get added to the `conf.py`
and the needed directories are created.
