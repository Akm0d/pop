=================
Pop Release 7.3.0
=================

This release fixes some bugs and makes the dyne loader more robust

Recursive Subdirs
=================

The hub.pop.sub.load_subdirs function got a new argument, `recurse`.
This allows subdir loading to be recursive if set to True.

This loading also allows for recursive subdirs to be loaded for
disparate dyne_name loads. This means that if your subsystem is
derived from multiple path sources the names get auto merged into
the correct paths.

Fix Issue With Class Loading
============================

We discovered that modules were getting reloaded too much and causing
issues with loading classes onto the `hub`. This has been fixed

Add DYNE to conf.py in pop-seed
===============================

`pop-seed` continues to be refined, not the `DYNE` dict is added by default
top the conf.py file created by `pop-seed`
