===============
Pop Release 7.5
===============

This release fixes a very minor memory issue and extends conf.

Multiple subs In Conf
=====================

While working on a new project I wanted to be able to have the same
options available across multiple subcommands in conf. 7.5 adds this
ability:

.. code-block:: python

    CLI_CONFIG = {
        'foo': {
            'default': False},
            'action': 'store_true',
            'subs': ['create', 'remove', 'edit'],
            },
    }
    
    SUBS = {
        'create': {
            'help': 'Create some things',
            'desc': Used to create the things,
        },
        'remove': {
            'help': 'Remove some things',
            'desc': Used to remove the things,
        },
        'edit': {
            'help': 'Edit some things',
            'desc': Used to edit the things,
        },
    }

Minor Memory Issue
==================

While running memory and profiling tests we discovered that if the dyne system
was called repeatedly that we leaked loading `conf.py` files. This has been fixed
and the performance of the dyne system at scale has been greatly improved!
