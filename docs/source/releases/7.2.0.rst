=================
Pop Release 7.1.0
=================

This release comes with a few fixes and minor additions.

Auto Load Plugins on Iteration
==============================

Plugins are normally lazy loaded, but when iterating over a subsystem
all plugins need to be loaded. Since one would expect to be able to
iterate over a sub, it has been added to automatically load all
of the plugins when starting to iterate.

Add Callbacks For Signal Catches
================================

The loop inside of `pop` can now be started with functions to call when
receiving signals on unix systems. This makes it easier to respond cleanly
to interrupt and term signals.
