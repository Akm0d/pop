Contracts
=========

One of the core components of `POP` is the contract system. When everything
is a plugin then these plugins need to be able to enforce the interface
they belong to. `POP` provides contracts to enable these interfaces.
Contracts can be used to define plugin interfaces, ensure that functions
that are needed are available, and that needed functions follow argument
signatures. Contracts can also define transparent wrappers, running
pre or post functions around function calls, or replacing the actual
function call.
